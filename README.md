**StrongDM's Strong Policy Engine Sample Policies**

StrongDM's Strong Policy Language is a domain-specific language that defines fine-grained permissions to resources managed by [StrongDM](https://strongdm.com/). They are expressive and allow you to implement context-based controls. Strong Policy Language extends the open-source [Cedar Policy Language](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/), created by AWS.

*This is a collection of sample policies that can be adapted and customized for your specific use cases.*
